# We Need Your Help

This project is large, and 

## Budget

Our current focus of the project is simply getting the sailbot built, and this
will require $5000 - $10000. Once the competition gets closer and we have more
information on the logistics of getting to the competition we will be needing
help to transport this machine from Vancouver to somewhere on the east coast.

# How You Can Get Involved

## Mentorship

An important resource for the team are experienced induviduals who we can bounce
ideas off of. This is a great way for professionals to get involved with the
project and seeing it come to fruition.

## Financial Sponsorship

In order to give back to our awesome sponsors, we have a few sponsor levels as
ways of saying thank you (Big surprise it involves stickers :P ). Yes, you could
infact have your company's logo not on the billowing flag of some antiquated
cruiser, but on the smooth sleek wingsail of the future.

### Captain - $500

For helping the sailbot team achieve their goals, a Bronze Level sponsor is
thanked on our webpage and a 64 in^2 logo on the wingsail.

### Admiral - $1000

A Silver Level sponsor is thanked with an article on our webpage as well as
a 144 in^2 logo on the wingsail.

### Blackbeard - $2500

For donating a large fraction of the sailbot budget, a Gold Level sponsor is
thanked with an article on our webpage as well as 400 in^2 logo on the wingsail.
