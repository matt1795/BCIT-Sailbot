# Wing Sail Design and Manufacturing

## Summary

This project entails the design and manufacturing of a rigid, self-trimming wing
sail assembly for the BCIT IEEE SailBot team. The design and manufacturing of
this project is centered around three main requirements: 1) Modularity for ease
of transport 2) Avoid the use of servo motors when positioning the sails 3) Keep
costs as low as possible.  “BCIT SailBot is a student initiative to design and
build an autonomous sailboat for the International Robotic Sailing Regatta
(IRSR). With a hull length of 2m, the Sailbot will be able to take information
on its environment, such as wind conditions and surrounding objects, and make
appropriate navigation decisions in order to reach its destination” (Mathew
Knight, http://www.ieeebcit.org/bcit-sailbot/).  All CAD designs and technical
drawings were produced using a BCIT provided student version of Solidworks 2016.
The final wing sail assembly consists of three separate sub-assemblies: the main
wing, the rear control wing and the wing sail mounting base.  All machined parts
was made using manual machining processes (lathe & mill). TIG welding was used
to fuse components of the mounting base together. Waterjet cutting was used to
produce the parts required to make the wing foil profile.  The material budget
for this project was $300.49, most of the material used in this project was
6061-T6 Aluminum. The wear-resistant bushings for the mounting system were made
of Teflon.  Labor cost for this project @ 40 hrs of work, were $3,585.00. The
labor cost were split up between manual mill ($110/hr), manual lathe ($90/hr),
TIG welding ($90/hr) and general labor ($45/hr).  Utilizing a 85-day production
period, the total cost of producing the rigid self-trimming wing sail was
$3,885.49 The manufactured rigid self-trimming wing sail assembly, consisting of
its three sub-assemblies, was donated to the BCIT IEEE SailBot Team upon
completion May 10th 2017.

## Introduction

In September 2016, the BCIT IEEE founded a team named BCIT SailBot. This team’s
goal was to design and build an autonomous sailboat. In 2018, the BCIT SailBot
team aims to enter the IRSR. The purpose of this competition is to showcase the
up and coming technology in the world of autonomous ocean voyages. The
development of this technology aids in collection of oceanic research data.
Autonomous research collection from an ecosystem such as the ocean helps to
maintain the environment. The BCIT sailbot is solar powered, which helps to
preserve an environment by eliminating the use of fossil fuels. Unoccupied
research vessels reduce the risk of “manmade” contamination of the ocean (eg.
Garbage falling overboard while collection ocean data).  My contribution, and
subsequently the scope of this report, was regarding the design and
manufacturing of a rigid, self-trimming wing sail assembly.

## Background

The symmetrical wing sail will generate lift in up to 15 knots of wind, causing
motion in the desired direction of sail. All self-trimming wing sails function
using the same principals. As wind passes over the wings, the rear wing’s angle
of attack is adjusted, this deflects the wind passing over the wings causing a
change in the pressure distribution across the wing surface (as seen in Figure
2). The pressure distribution causes the sail assembly to rotate about its
freely pivoting mast, causing the sail to find its desired sailing position.

[Figure 2: Pressure Distribution Across a Wing Profile](../images/foil.png)
Figure 2: Pressure Distribution Across a Wing Profile

The key design feature distinguishing the BCIT SailBot wing sail from other sail
configurations is the lack of any traditional rigging (eg. UBC ADA Figure 3)
(rigging are ropes used to position the sail, this is achieved by applying
tension to the lines with winches) and the lack of a servo motor used to
position the rear wing (eg. SailDrone Figure 4).

The BCIT sailboat utilizes a mechanical design solution and a linear actuator to
attain rotational positioning of the rear wing, this configuration is preferred
over rigging as it simplifies the programming when automating the process. For a
small-scale application (2m hull length) a servo motors requires a large amount
of energy relative to the amount of power allocated for the control system;
linear actuators require less electrical power than servo motors, again making
the BCIT configuration desirable.  The solution proposed provides BCIT sailbot
with industry relevant technology, emulating that of professional companies such
as SailDrone (Figure 4), while maintaining a competitive advantage over
traditional rigged sail systems used by local competitors.

## Manufacturing Budget

The total cost for the project was $3,885.49. The labor costs for this project
were $1,228.66 over budget, this can be attributed to my lack of experience in
manual machining operation and set up. The price per hour for production was set
at industry standard Journeymen rates, while my production ability is much below
that of a trained professional. Going forward with the project, the deficient
production rate can be isolated as an assignable cause, as repeating production
of this project would be carried out by a professional manufacturing team.  The
majority of the material used in this process was 6061 aluminum. The remainder
of the material was Teflon, used to create the wear resistant bushings in the
mounting base. The Teflon was donated by Avanti Aerospace to the BCIT Sailbot
team.  6061 aluminum was chosen because it was the lightest and easiest material
to work with, that would survive a salt water environment and fit within the
teams very small budget.  Originally Delrin was chosen for a bushing material
because of its increased toughness and superior wear resistant properties in a
wet environment, but due to its high price and limited local availability,
alternate materials (ie. Teflon) had to be sourced.  Teflon provides a
sufficiently low friction material for bushings in the mounting base. Like
Delrin, Teflon is often used in marine applications and was more than sufficient
for the operating conditions of the wing sail.

## Production Timeline

The manufacturing process is divided up into two distinct parts: 1) The wing
sail structure 2) The mounting base. Shown in Figure 5, a 85-day production run
was be used to produce all required parts.  The project was 18 hrs over the
estimated timeline. As mentioned above, the extra hours were caused by my
inexperience with manual machining processes.

## The Manufacturing Process

1) The Wing Sail Structure (Figure 7) The wing structure is made entirely out of
6061 aluminum and consists of 6 main parts labeled below in corresponding color.

Stringers The stringers for both the main and rear wing section were made on the
manual mill. A set up (Figure 8) consisting of a vice and a ¼” square bar, set
perpendicular to the vice and 10.5 inches away from the left edge, was used to
repeatedly locate the notches. A 3/16” endmill was used to make the notches in
the stringers. An 80 degree countersink was used to countersink the fasteners
flush with the outside of the rear and main sections.

Masts The rear and main mast were purchased components. The rear mast did not
require any additional work to attain the desired dimensions. The main mast came
from the supplier 0.023” under the requested size, this made the tube unusable
without further processing. Two aluminum sleeves were turned on the lathe and
press-fitted onto the masts. Subsequently, the Teflon bushings in the mounting
base had to be bored to a larger size to compensate for the sleeves pressed on
to the main mast.        

Wing Sections Along with the control system, the wing profiles were the largest
design components of the assembly. In order to generate the types of thrust
needed to sail a ship, it was determined a symmetrical profile was necessary to
generate lift in any desired direction.  The NACA 0009 and NACA 0019 wing
profile sections (Figure 9) were cut out on the water jet cutter at BCIT.
Following this they were drilled and tapped for #10–24 (NACA 0019) and #6-32
(NACA 0009) fasteners to accept the stringers; this was done on a drill press at
BCIT.

2) The Wing Sail Mounting Base (Figure 10) The mounting flange and mast housing,
along with the bracers, were TIG welded together with a 3/8” all around fillet
weld (Figure 10). The flange was then placed into a manual lathe where the
bottom surface of the mounting flange (Figure 11) was machined flat with a 1
rad, diamond shaped, carbide insert. The inner bore diameter was machined with a
1 rad VNMG carbide inserted boring bar (Figure 12).  The Top and bottom spacers
(Figure 13) along with the Teflon bushings (Figure 14) were turned on the manual
lathe as well.

Assembly The final assembly of the wing sail took 1 hr to complete. The only
tools required to assemble the wing were a Robertson screw driver and a 3/16”
Alan key.

## Conclusion

The completion of this project will provide BCIT SailBot with a self-trimming
wing sail assembly prototype, this assembly is to be used in conjunction with
the BCIT SailBot hull and automated control system.  The finished product will
compete in the International Robotic Sailing Regatta in 2018, led by team
captain Matthew Knight.    

## Lessons Learnt

Manufacturing of a rigid, self-trimming wing sail for the BCIT IEEE SailBot team
provided opportunity to utilize skills in process planning, manual machining
processes, shop etiquette and time management. 

## Future Work 

Moving forward with the project the team plans to: 
- Finish manufacturing the control system
- Purchase more Mylar for sail material
- Extend the length of the rear control wing from 3ft to 5ft
- Compete a sailing force generation test with the finished assembly 
- Begin testing the wing sail with the automated control system from the
  mechatronics team

If the team ever receives a sufficient sponsorship budget and the school gains
access to higher level composite manufacturing techniques, it is strongly
suggested to redesign and rebuild the wing sail out of a carbon fiber composite.
This would drastically decrease the weight of the assembly and would mimic
exactly the materials used by professional wing sail manufacturers.
