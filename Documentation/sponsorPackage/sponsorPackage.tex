\section*{A Letter from the Leader}

Hello!

If you're reading this, I take it that you're interested in our sailbot project.

If BCIT has anything, it's talent and excellent facilities. 


Matthew Knight,
BCIT Sailbot Team Captain

\section*{Who We Are}

BCIT Sailbot is a student initiative under the IEEE BCIT Student Branch to 
design and build an autonomous sailboat, or "sailbot" for the International 
Robotic Sailing Regatta (IRSR) in June 2017. This will be BCIT's first time 
competing and we intend to win. 

Our team consists of a half-dozen students that come from BCIT's Mechatronics,
Electrical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering programs. These are students 
who, ontop of their formal education in engineering, wish to dedicate even more 
time to be part of a challenging project.

\section*{Sail What?}

A sailbot is an autonomous sailboat. By relying on the wind for propulsion, and 
using solar power to reliably power the entire craft we have a vehicle that is
well suited for long distance voyages.

Sailbots have great potential in applications such as fish stock management, 
environmental monitoring for the mining and petroleum industries and 
oceanography. It is a developing technology and competitions like the IRSR give
students the opportunity to contribute to its advancement.

One of our keys to success will be our use of a self-trimming wing sail over
a traditional sail. This design reduces the number of control points, eliminates
the need for rigging, and significantly increases mechanical robustness needed
for autonomous sailing. BCIT is also set appart from other institutions because
we will have the ability to do most, if not all of the manufacturing in our own
facilities.

\section*{The Competition}

Every year teams from across the world come to compete at the International 
Robotic Sailing Regatta competition. At the IRSR, there are a number of races 
that test navigation, tactics and design. During the competiton, the saiboat 
must steer and trim sails based on measurements of the wind, position, and 
direction without human intervention. 

This year IRSR takes place in Annapolis, Maryland June 11 - 16th at the United 
States Naval Academy. If you'd like to check out the IRSR some more, their 
website is right \href{http://sailbot.org}{here}.

\section*{Why We Need Your Help}


%More than anything else, developing a state of the art robotic sailboat requires 
%dedication from the entire team. It also requires advanced materials, high-tech 
%microcontrollers, accurate sensors and powerful communication equipment, and to
%top it all off we need to get the team and the sailbot to the East Coast. All of
%these are expensive, and this is why your support is so critical to the success 
%of our team.

\subsection*{Sailbot Budget: \$14700}

\subsection*{Sponsorship Levels}

\subsubsection*{Captain - \$500}

For helping the sailbot team achieve their goals, a Bronze Level sponsor is
thanked on our webpage and a small logo on the sailbot.

\subsubsection*{Admiral - \$1000}

A Silver Level sponsor is thanked with an article on our webpage as well as
the placement of their logo on the sailbot.

\subsubsection*{Blackbeard - \$2500}

For donating a large fraction of the sailbot budget, a Gold Level sponsor is
thanked with an article on our webpage as well as prominant graphic of their
logo on the sailbot.
