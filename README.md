# BCIT-Sailbot
Repository for the BCIT Sailbot Project. This github page will also serve as an organizational tool for the team.

Projects contain "issues" pertaining to that component of the project. Many issues will deal with design choices and once significant discussion has happened on a subject a decission will take place, and then the issue will be closed.

As the project moves further, issues will then take the form of tasks, be it coding, designing, or actually building a part.
